## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an opportunity for me to practice the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, along with other technologies that assist in the art of web development.

### Continued development

I'm in the process of developing a workflow that is backed by experience and familiarity with the types of tasks that I might run into as a web developer. So while I might take longer than usual accomplishing individual components, I'm hopeful that with perseverence, i'll build the muscle memory and the foresight that will increase my effectiveness.
